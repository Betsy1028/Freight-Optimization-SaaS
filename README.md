Welcome to my Freight Load Optimization SaaS—a scalable software solution designed to streamline load planning, reduce inefficiencies, and boost operational performance across logistics networks.

## 🧠 About Me

I'm Betsy Fernandez, a logistics strategist turned cybersecurity enthusiast with a knack for operational efficiency and structured processes. With years of experience managing vendor relationships, auditing freight data, and customizing procedures for dynamic environments, I built this SaaS to solve real-world logistics challenges using smart technology.

## 🚀 What This SaaS Does

This system tackles load optimization by:
- Analyzing freight data to identify cost-effective load combinations
- Factoring in constraints like weight limits, delivery deadlines, and carrier preferences

- **Algorithms**: Custom load optimization logic with heuristic methods
- **Cloud Deployment**: Vercel (for lightweight and scalable hosting)

## 📈 Why It Matters

Freight optimization isn't just about cutting costs—it’s about improving environmental impact, building resilience into supply chains, and unlocking the full potential of operational teams. This SaaS is a step toward smarter freight management.
